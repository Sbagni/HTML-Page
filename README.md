**Latitude Analysis Dashboard**

Data is more powerful when we share it with others!  We used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

For this project we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a previous assignment. Specifically, we plotted [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, we created individual pages for each plot and we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
